					<p>Have you ever met someone with a first name like Setu?  Me either.  Fun fact, I am the only Setu in the United States.  In fact, all of North America.  I'm going to guess South America also but cannot confirm.  There are people named Setu in India though and I think somewhere in Europe too.  How cool would it have been if I was the only Setu in the entire world?  That would be awesome to me.

					As far as my last name, Biswas, it is as common as Jones hahaha.  My last name is very common in India but I have not met anyone in the United States with a last name Biswas to whom I was not related to.  In fact, only my parents and my brother are the only family I have in the United States.  One of my mom's cousins (guess she would be an aunt) did move to Toronto with her family so I do have extended family in Canada.
					<br><br>
					I was born and raised in the United States along with my brother.  We are first generation Indian Americans.  Both my parents immigrated from Bangladesh while some of their relatives moved to Calcutta in India.  I grew up in Lafayette, Indiana then lived in Chicago (which is like a second home to me), then moved to Peoria, Illinois, and now I am finally here in Austin.  I have only been here for 4 months and loving it!  I'm excited to see where this city takes me in life.</p>
